                    <p>The word "Yoga" comes from the Sanskrit language, meaning union or merger. The goal of this discipline is to strike a balance between body, mind and breath, with the ultimate aim of attaining self-enlightenment. It has been estimated by some scholars that Yoga is about 5000 years old. Several scientists also claim that it is a highly developed and scientific discipline for healthy living that has been perfected through milleniums.</p>

                    <p> Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: “Howsoever men approach Me, even so
                        do I reward them, for, the path men take from every side, is Mine, O Partha.” The four paths are: the
                        path of work (<b>Karma-Yoga</b>), the path of devotion or love (<b>Bhakti-Yoga</b>), the path of psychic control
                        (<b>Raja-Yoga</b>) and the path of self-analysis and knowledge (<b>Jnana-Yoga</b>).</p>

                <p>
                Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.

Let us prostrate before Patanjali, an incarnation of Adisesa, whose upper body has a human form, whose arms hold a conch and a disc, and who is crowned by a thousand-headed cobra.

                    * The rapid active exhalations with passive effortless inhalations are accomplished by flapping movements of the abdomen. At the end of the minute there is an automatic cessation of breath. Enjoy the deep silence of mind associated with this. <br>

                            Neti, in general, purifies most structures in the head and neck. Neti not only clears the nasal passages but also renders the nose resistant to many irritants like water, cotton, rubber, ghee, milk etc. Hence it is very helpful in removing the hypersensitivity as seen in persons suffering from allergic rhinitis. Vision becomes more subtle.

                        * Exhale completely through the mouth; expand the chest by mock-inhalation movement sucking in the relaxed abominal muscles so that they lie flat almost in touch with the back bone. This is practised at the end of Kumbhaka before the beginning of Recaka. This is also the first stage of Nauli Kriya. Maintain for some time and then inhale slowly.

                <p>
                 A certain king used to inquire of all the Sannyasins that came to his country, "Which is the greater man—he who gives up the world and becomes a Sannyasin, or he who lives in the world and performs his duties as a householder?" Many wise men sought to solve the problem. Some asserted that the Sannyasin was the greater, upon which the king demanded that they should prove their assertion. When they could not, he ordered them to marry and become householders. Then others came and said, "The householder who performs his duties is the greater man." Of them, too, the king demanded proofs. When they could not give them, he made them also settle down as householders.

                At last there came a young Sannyasin, and the king similarly inquired of him also. He answered, "Each, O king, is equally great in his place." "Prove this to me," asked the king. "I will prove it to you," said the Sannyasin, "but you must first come and live as I do for a few days, that I may be able to prove to you what I say." The king consented and followed the Sannyasin out of his own territory and passed through many other countries until they came to a great kingdom. In the capital of that kingdom a great ceremony was going on. The king and the Sannyasin heard the noise of drums and music, and heard also the criers; the people were assembled in the streets in gala dress, and a great proclamation was being made. The king and the Sannyasin stood there to see what was going on. The crier was proclaiming loudly that the princess, daughter of the king of that country, was about to choose a husband from among those assembled before her.

                It was an old custom in India for princesses to choose husbands in this way, each princess had certain ideas of the sort of man she wanted for a husband; some would have the handsomest man; others would have only the most learned; others again the richest, and so on. All the princes of the neighbourhood put on their bravest attire and presented themselves before her. Sometimes they too had their own criers to enumerate their advantages and the reasons why they hoped the princess would choose them. The princess was taken round on a throne, in the most splendid array and looked at and heard about them. If she was not pleased with what she saw and heard, she said to her bearers, "Move on," and no more notice was taken of the rejected suitors. If, however, the princess was pleased with any one of them she threw a garland of flowers over him and he became her husband.

                The princess of the country to which our king and the Sannyasin had come was having one of these interesting ceremonies. She was the most beautiful princess in the world, and the husband of the princess would be ruler of the kingdom after her father's death. The idea of this princess was to marry the handsomest man, but she could not find the right one to please her. Several times these meetings had taken place, but the princess could not select a husband. This meeting was the most splendid of all; more people than ever had come to it. The princess came in on a throne, and the bearers carried her from place to place. She did not seem to care for any one, and every one became disappointed that this meeting also was going to be a failure. Just then came a young man, a Sannyasin, handsome as if the sun had come down to the earth, and stood in one corner of the assembly, watching what was going on. The throne with the princess came near him, and as soon as she saw the beautiful Sannyasin, she stopped and threw the garland over him. The young Sannyasin seized the garland and threw it off, exclaiming, "What nonsense is this? I am a Sannyasin. What is marriage to me?" The king of that country thought that perhaps this man was poor and so dared not marry the princess, and said to him, "With my daughter goes half my kingdom now, and the whole kingdom after my death!" and put the garland again on the Sannyasin. The young man threw it off once more, saying, "Nonsense. I do not want to marry," and walked quickly away from the assembly.

                Now the princess had fallen so much in love with this young man that she said, "I must marry this man or I shall die;" and she went after him to bring him back. Then our other Sannyasin, who had brought the king there, said to him, "King, let us follow this pair; " so they walked after them, but at a good distance behind. The young Sannyasin who had refused to marry the princess walked out into the country for several miles; when he came to a forest and entered into it, the princess followed him, and the other two followed them. Now this young Sannyasin was well acquainted with that forest and knew all the intricate paths in it, he suddenly passed into one of these and disappeared, and the princess could not discover him. After trying for a long time to find' him she sat down under a tree and began to weep, for she did not know the way out. Then our king and the other Sannyasin came up to her and said, "Do not weep; we will show you the way out of this forest, but it is too dark for us to find it now. Here is a big tree; let us rest under it, and in the morning we will go early and show you the road."

                Now a little bird and his wife and their three little ones lived on that tree, in a nest. This little bird looked down and saw the three people under the tree and said to his wife, "My dear, what shall we do; here are some guests in the house, and it is winter, and we have no fire?" So he flew away and got a bit of burning firewood in his beak and dropped it before the guests, to which they added fuel and made a blazing fire. But the little bird was not satisfied. He said again to his wife, "My dear, what shall we do? There is nothing to give these people to eat, and they are hungry. We are householders; it is our duty to feed any one who comes to the house. I must do what I can, I will give them my body." So he plunged into the midst of the fire and perished. The guests saw him falling and tried to save him, but he was too quick for them.

                The little bird's wife saw what her husband did, and she said, "Here are three persons and only one little bird for them to eat. It is not enough; it is my duty as a wife not to let my husband's effort go in vain; let them have my body also;" then she fell into the fire and was burned to death. 

                Then the three baby-birds, when they saw what was done and that there was still not enough food for the three guests, said, "Our parents have done what they could and still it is not enough. It is our duty to carry on the work of our parents; let our bodies go too." And they all dashed down into the fire also.

                Amazed at what they saw, the three people could not of course eat these birds. They passed the night without food and in the morning the king and the Sannyasin showed the princess the way, and she went back to her father.

                Then the Sannyasin said to the king, "King, you have seen that each is great in his own place. If you want to live in the world live like those birds, ready at any moment to sacrifice yourself for others. If you want to renounce the world be like that young man to whom the most beautiful woman and a kingdom were as nothing. If you want to be a householder hold your life a sacrifice for the welfare of others; and if you choose the life of renunciation do not even look at beauty, and money and power. Each is great in his own place, but the duty of the one is not the duty of the other."

            <p>
            A young Sannyasin went to a forest; there he meditated, worshipped, and practised Yoga for a long time. After years of hard work and practice, he was one day sitting under a tree, when some dry leaves fell upon his head. He looked up and saw a crow and a crane fighting on the top of the tree, which made him very angry. He said, "What! Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!" As with these words he angrily glanced at them, a flash of fire went out of his head --such was the Yogi's power--and burnt the birds to ashes. He was very glad, almost overjoyed at this development of power--he could burn the crow and the crane by a look. <br>
 
            After a time he had to go to the town to beg his bread. He went, stood at a door, and said, "Mother, give me food." A voice came from inside the house, "Wait a little, my son." The young man thought, "You wretched woman, how dare you make me wait! You do not know my power yet." While he was thinking thus the voice came again: "Boy, don't be thinking too much of yourself. Here is neither crow nor crane." <br>
            He was astonished; still he had to wait. At last the woman came, and he fell at her feet and said, "Mother, how did you know that?" She said, "My boy, I do not know your Yoga or your practices. I am a common everyday woman. I made you wait because my husband is ill, and I was nursing him. All my life I have struggled to do my duty. When I was unmarried, I did my duty to my parents; now that I am married, I do my duty to my husband; that is all the Yoga I practise. But by doing my duty I have become illumined; thus I could read your thoughts and know what you had done in the forest. If you want to know something higher than this, go to the market of such and such a town where you will find a Vyadha who will tell you something that you will be very glad to learn." <br>
 
            The Sannyasin thought, "Why should I go to that town and to a Vyadha?" But after what he had seen, his mind opened a little, so he went. When he came near the town, he found the market and there saw, at a distance, a big fat Vyadha cutting meat with big knives, talking and bargaining with different people. The young man said, "Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going to learn? He is the incarnation of a demon, if he is anything." In the meantime this man looked up and said, "O Swami, did that lady send you here? Take a seat until I have done my business." <br>
 
            The Sannyasin thought, "What comes to me here?" He took his seat; the man went on with his work, and after he had finished he took his money and said to the Sannyasin, "Come sir, come to my home." On reaching home the Vyadha gave him a seat, saying, "Wait here," and went into the house. He then washed his old father and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them, after which he came to the Sannyasin and said, "Now, sir, you have come here to see me; what can I do for you?" The Sannyasin asked him a few questions about soul and about God, and the Vyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the Mahabharata, called the Vyadha Gita . It contains one of the highest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his teaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, "Why are you in that body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a Vyadha's body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?" "My son," replied the Vyadha, "no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth placed me in these circumstances and environments. In my boyhood I learnt the trade; I am unattached, and I try to do my duty well. I try to do my duty as a householder, and I try to do all I can to make my father and mother happy. I neither know your Yoga, nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of the world into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen has come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which belongs to my position."

            <div class="panel" title="Sectional Breathing" id="sect">
                <div>
                    <p>This is a preparatory breathing practice for doing Pranayama. It chiefly corrects the breathing pattern and increases the vital capacity of the lungs. It has 3 sections: <br></p>
                    <p><h4> Abdominal Breathing (Adhama)</h4> <br>
                    * Sit erect in Vajrasana. Exhale. Inhale completely, slowly and continuously. This is called Puraka. The abdomen is made to bulge continuously with the air entering especially into the lower section of the lungs. Before exhaling, stop the breath (Antarya Kumbhaka) for a second. While exhaling (Recaka) the abdomen is drawn inwards continuously and slowly. Before the breath is reversed, stop the breath (Bahya Kumbhaka) for a second and inhale. Repeat the breathing cycle. There should be no jerks in the whole process. It should be smooth, continuous and relaxing. <br>
                    * The diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen descends during inhalation with the bulging of the abdomen. This increases the air-flow into the lower sections of the lungs. The rhythmic movement of the diaphragm massages the contents of the abdomen gently, and helps the organs to function normally. It promotes the general circulation also. <br>
                    
                    <h4> Thoracic (Chest) Breathing</h4> <br>
                    In this sectional breathing performed while sitting erect in Vajrasana, inhalation and exhalation are performed by expanding and contracting the chest only. Air flows through both nostrils, slowly and continuously. The abdomen is controlled to avoid its bulging. <br>
                    The middle lobes are opened up fully by this type of breathing. <br>
                    <h4> Upper Lobar Breathing</h4> <br>
                    Sit erect in Vajrasana. Raise the collar bones while inhaling. Keep the abdominal muscles contracted. The air is forced into the uppermost regions of the lungs thus ventilating the upper lobes. <br>
                    The sparingly used upper lobes of the lungs will be properly aerated by this breathing.<br><br>
                    These 3 sectionalised breathings are also called 'Adhama'. 'Madhyama' and 'Adya'. In complete Yogic breathing technique all the above 3 types will be combined. During inhalation, the Adhama, Madhyama and Adya occur sequentially and during exhalation the same sequence namely abdominal, chest andClavicular breathings occur. The whole process should be relaxing and comfortable, without any tensions in the face. <br>
                    Four Mudras are generally associated with these sectional breathings. They are Cin Mudra for Adhama, Cinmaya Mudra for Madhyama, Adi Mudra for Adya and Brahma Mudra for complete Yogic breathing.

            <div class="panel" title="Bhastrika Pranayama" id="bhastrika">
                <div>
                    <p><center>Bhastrika Pranayama</center></p>
                    <p>* Sit comfortably in an erect spine position. <br>
                    * Perform deep and long inhalations and exhalations continuously. <br>
                    * During the practice, emphasize more on the thorax activity. <br>
                    * The speed of breathing is 120 strokes as in <a href = "#kapala"> Kapalabhati </a>.<br>
                    * After 10-15 strokes, halt the practice and enjoy the Kevala Kumbhaka (automatic suspension of breathing) by being silent. Continue after a minute. Repeat 3 rounds.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3> Benefits :</h3> Increases the blood circulation in the body. Very good for chronic cold, nasal allergies and various respiratory ailments. Supplements the benefits of <a href = "#kapala"> Kapalabhati </a>. <br>
                    Persons suffering from epilepsy and hypertension should avoid this practice. <br>
                    * The flapping of the abdomen resembles the blacksmitj's bellows and hence it is Bhastrika.            
                    
                    </p>

            <div class="panel" title="Anuloma-Viloma" id="anuloma">
                <div>
                    <p><center>Simple Inhalation - Exhalation Pranayama</center></p>
                    <p>* Sit erect in Padmasana or Vajrasana (any meditative posture) with head, trunk and buttocks in a straight line. Close your eyes and exhale completely. <br>
                    * Inhale through both the nostrils slowly and steadily without making any sound. <br>
                    * Exhale slowly, continuously and silently. <br>
                    * Have inhalation and exhalation for the same duration (say 20 secs each). During exhalation the chest goes down and the abdomen is taken in. Both the chest and the abdomen expand during inhalation; rhythmic breathing.<br>
                    * There is no holding of breath (Kumbhaka). Mental recitation of 'AUM' can be followed during inhalation and exhalation as well. It is good to practise this at dawn and sunset (though not mandatory), in empty stomach.<br>
                    * One can have about 10 to 15 rounds to start with, and can go upto 30 rounds. ONe inhalation and one exhalation means one round. One must practise Anuloma-Viloma for atleast 3 months continuously to perceive the benefits. <br>
                    * The whole practice is to be done in a very relaxed way, with least exhaustion. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3> Benefits :</h3> Lungs, heart and stomach get purified, rhythmic breathing is the result. Lung capacity also increases. Helps in curing the diseases pertaining to lungs. Heart-beat gets normalized.

                    <p><center>Purification of subtle perception paths</center></p>
                    <p>* The Nadi Suddhi is similar to Anuloma-Viloma, with the difference that inhalation and exhalation are done through alternate nostrils. <br>
                    * Sit erect in Padmasena (or any other meditative posture). Exhale completely. <br>
                    * Close the right nostril with the thumb of the right hand. Inhale slowly, steadily and deeply as long as possible. Follow the entire course of the breath by feeling the movement of air. Do not hold the breath inside. <br>
                    * Release the right and close the left nostril with the little and ring fingers of the right hand, and breathe out through the right nostril. Again breathe in through the right nostril and then breathe out through the left nostril. This forms one round of Nadi Suddhi.<br>
                    * Inhalation and exhalation from each side should be of the same duration. (In the beginning the duration may be unequal). <br>
                    * 'AUM' can be mentally recited during inhalation and exhalation. <br>
                    * To start with, one can have 9 rounds and this can gradually be increased to about 25 or 30 rounds. <br>
                    * Early morning and late evening are good for this practice. <br><br>
                    <h3> Benefits </h3>: Anuloma-Viloma and the Nadi Suddhi are the foundations for the practice of good pranayama. One has to practise these for a duration of 3 to 6 months to accomplish the purification of the Nadis (72 lakhs) and Cakras (which exist in the subtle body , called Pranayama kosa). The effect is described as :<br>
                    'He achieves purification of Nadis marked by distinct signs - lightness of body, brightness of eyes and increase in apetite.'

                    <p><center>Hissing Pranayama</center></p>
                    <p>* Sit comfortably in any of the meditative postures with the spine erect.<br>
                    * Start inhaling slowly through both nostrils. The incoming air should be felt at the upper palate. By partially closing the glottis, a sibilant (s) sound is produced in the throat. <br>
                    * While making a swallowing movement, bend the neck forward and allow the breath to stop automatically and effortlessly. <br>
                    * While maintaining, relax the head region and feel the locking of air below the throat. Exhale slowly through left nostril and continuously making a hissing noise at the throat by partial contraction of the glottis.<br>
                    * This completes one cycle. Repeat 9 rounds. <br>
                    * In other types of Ujjayi, single nostril inhalation and exhalation are used. The airway resistance at the palate is the important aspect of this Pranayama. It helps to reduce the speed of breathing.

                <h2> About Swamy Vivekananda </h2> <br>
                Swami Vivekananda has influenced young minds to walk on the path of enlightenment for more than a centennial. Stretching his wings of spirituality out to the world, he started a revolution which still resonates among millions of his followers. Born on January 12th, 1863, Vivekananda's teachings continues to be a powerhouse of knowledge. <br>
                From a young age, he took delight in various subjects, including religion, philosophy, art, literature and social sciences. He was also drawn towards the sacred books of the Hindu religion. Bewitched in the charm of wandering monks, he started meditating before the idols of Lord Shiva, Lord Rama and Mahavir Hanuman. <br>
                Curiosity in his eyes and the desire to get closer to the supreme power, he once asked his Guru, Sri Ramakrishna, "<i> Have you seen God?</i> Without any qualms, his master replied, "<i> Yes, I have. I see Him as clearly as I see you, only in a much intenser sense</i>". <br>
                The pain of the loss of his dear ones gave him the sense of an inner awakening and he founded the Ramakrishna Mission and extended his knowledge to the West. Even after hise death on July 4, 1902, his words of wisdom echo through the walls of the spiritual world - "<i> Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy - by one or more, or all of these - and be free.</i> <br><br>
                
                <h3> Four Pathways </h3> <br>
                Swamy Vivekananda spelt out the four pathways of attaining moksha from the worldly pleasure and attachments in his books - Karma-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, Raja-Yoga and Jnana Yoga. <br><br>
                <h4><b>Karma-Yoga</b></h4> or the yoga of selfless action tells that through the correct actions, the 'troublemaker' ego can turn into the 'troubleshooter' ego. It says that even if you dont believe in God, just focus on your work with utmost honesty, dedication and power of your mind. Be non-attached and keep working for work's sake. Instead of worrying about the results, leave the fruits of your work to the Lord. <br> <br>
                <h4><b>Bhakti-Yoga</b></h4> is the process of inner purification. Love is the vital element of all humna beings, it teaches. Love is pure and cosmic, but ego pollutes it and gives out negative elements like lust, greed, jealousy and anger. God is the only one who truly loves us. Pour holy thoughts into the mind with orayer, chant holy words, study holy books and keep the holy compnay close to your heart. <br> <br>
                <h4><b>Raja-Yoga</b></h4> seeks to attain the divine by igniting the flame of knowledge of the self within. Most seekers do not have the patience and perseverance to follow the path of reason. Teaching the process of meditation and concentration, it tells you to confront the restlessness of the mind and uproot it. <br> <br>
                <h4><b>Jnana-Yoga</b></h4> is the path of knowledge . Weeding out the darkness of ignorance through the light of knowledge, it  brings the 'fire' and 'light' alive by burning all the impurities of the mind. The mind does not give up its attachment to wordly pleasures unless it has tasted something greater and higher. Self-knowledge according to jnana-yoga, is true liberation.               
                    
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel" data-title="Yogic Lore" id="story" >
                <p>
                There is a wonderful story in the yogic lore. One day, a gnana yogi, a bhakti yogi, a karma yogi, and a kriya yogi were walking together in a forest. Usually these four people can never be together, because a gnana yogi has total disdain for every other yoga. An intellectual person, a thinking person has complete disdain for everybody else. A bhakti yogi, full of emotion and love, thinks all this gnana, karma and kriya yoga is just a waste of time. Just love God and it will happen. The karma yogi thinks that everybody is lazy and have all kinds of fancy philosophies. What needs to be done is work. One must work, work and work. The kriya yogi just laughs at everything. The whole existence is energy. If you don’t transform your energy, whether you long for God or you long for anything, nothing is going to happen. <br> <br>

                So they cannot be together, but today they were walking together. It started to rain. They started running, looking for shelter, and found an ancient temple which just had a roof – no walls on the sides. In the center, there was a linga. These people went inside the temple for shelter. The storm grew more furious and started blowing in torrents. The fury of the storm was getting into the temple so they went closer and closer to the linga. There was no other way to be because it was just blasting them from all sides. Then it became very furious. The only way they could get some protection was for all four to hug the linga. Suddenly they felt something enormous happening. A huge presence, a fifth presence was there. Then all of them said, “Why now? For so many years we have pursued You and nothing happened. Why now?” <br> <br>

                Shiva said, “At last the four of you got together. I have been waiting for this to happen for a long time.” <br><br>

                Without addressing the four basic ingredients of body, mind, emotion and energy out of which all your present experiences are rooted, one cannot move ahead. You can only start a journey from where you are right now.

                <h4>AUM</h4> is the divine word, the primordial sound, the real name of the Supreme Being in the Vedas. It is the most sacred of all spiritual sounds and vibrations and holds divinr miraculous powers. <br> <br>

                Yogis meditate on AUM to invoke the Supreme Being to offer their devotion to the Supreme Self in their hearts and to meditate on the Supreme Presence within their purified consciousness with a view to establishing a spiritual connection with AUM and to enjoy divine communion with the Source, Support and Substratum of everything.  <br> <br>

                AUM is composed of three letters A-U-M, and is invoked three times before any spiritual practice. This is so because AUM ,the divine principle, has three levels of reality.  <br><br>

                AUM is A: Absolute Transcendental being, Paramatman, the Supreme Soul or Self, which is beyond thought , description and imagination. <br>
                AUM reveals itself as this level as "SATCHITANANDA": pure Beingness, Awareness, Wholeness. <br><br>
                
                AUM is U: Universal Immanent Being, Vishvatman, the Cosmic Life or Self, which has become the universe and which is present in each and every particle of the universe as the Animating, Underlying, Maintaining Power. <br>
                AUM, the Cosmic Light, performs three main tasks at this level: Generation, Organisation, Destruction. Aum is also known as Adhidaivam, the Universal God or Providence.<br><br>
                
                AUM is M: Mental Superconscious Being, Jivatman, the super conscious Life or Self, which is a reflection of the Universal Life at individual level. It Animates, Maintains and Enlightens the individual’s existence: body, breath, brain, mind, ego and all organs, faculties, and experiences. <br>
                AUM, the Superconscious Light, has a spiritual connection with both the Universal Light and the Transcendental Light. It reveals itself as Sat-chid-ananda to the spiritual adept in deep meditation.
